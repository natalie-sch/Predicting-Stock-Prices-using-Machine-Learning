# Predicting Stock Prices using Machine Learning
## Model Analysis for Algorithmic Trading

This paper reviews the feasibility of the prediction of stock prices. The Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests stock price prediction is not possible. Therefore, we will analyze a series of models in terms of accuracy and efficiency to determine if we agree with this hypothesis, and if not, which model is best suited for stock price prediction. We determine that there is promise regarding predicting stock prices with the ARIMA and LSTM models, which would benefit from further investigation, further features, and potentially an ensemble approach.
